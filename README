Plugin for handling the transfer of production data to the local dev environment, or to a staging server.

# downloads the production data to the local machine
rake get_production_data

# imports data into the local database while filtering email addresses so the app doesn't send emails to live customers
rake import_production_data

# convenience command combining the previous two
rake get_and_import_production_data

# does the above steps, but pushes the data to the staging server
cap production_data:db:clone_prod_to_staging_with_filtering
